# Responsive-Grid-Layout

A clean, fully responsive landing page built exclusively with HTML5 and CSS3. This project showcases the power of CSS Grid and Media Queries to create complex, content-specific layouts that adapt seamlessly across devices (Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile).

‚ú® Features & Technical Focus
This layout is specifically engineered to demonstrate adaptive design based on content type:

CSS Grid for Structure: Utilizes CSS Grid to handle the overall two-dimensional layout, ensuring stable rows and columns across all viewports.


Pure Responsiveness: Relies only on Media Queries and flexible CSS units (no heavy frameworks) to handle breakpoints.

Clean and Maintainable CSS: Focuses on clear class naming and efficient layout properties.
